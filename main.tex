\section{Introduction}

12:20 (``twelve-twenty'') is a lightweight genre-agnostic role-playing game
meant to be played simultaneously with a d20~System or similar game, in order to
provide a side activity using the same characters as in a concurrent game. While
it is designed primarily for \emph{Pathfinder, Second Edition}, it can be easily
adapted to other systems.

\section{The 12:20 Check}
When a character in a 12:20~scene wishes to take an action that has a chance of
failure, they must make a \emph{12:20~check}.

The character receives two~$d12$s. These are their \emph{attempt dice}. They
also receive a~$d20$. This is the \emph{difficulty die}. There are only ever
two attempt dice and one difficulty die in play for any given check.
Additionally, beneficial circumstances may grant the character \emph{bonus
dice}, and detrimental circumstances may confer \emph{penalty dice}. The
entire dice pool is rolled together, and the total of the attempt and bonus dice
are compared against the total of the difficulty and penalty dice. If the total
of the attempt and bonus dice is greater, the check results in a success.
Otherwise, the check results in a failure.

\subsection{Bonus and Penalty Dice}
Bonus dice are granted by circumstances that improve the character's ability to
succeed at a check. Examples include proficiency levels in a single relevant
skill, or assistance granted by an ally. For each positive circumstance, add
one~$d6$ to the check's bonus dice.

Penalty dice are conferred by circumstances that significantly reduce a
character's ability to succeed at a check. For each negative circumstance, add
one~$d10$ to the check's penalty dice. There may only be six penalty dice for
any given check.

\subsection{Caveats}
\emph{Caveats} are narrative effects that influence the result of a check. If
every two attempt dice that roll higher than the difficulty die, add an
\emph{advantage}. For every two attempt dice that roll lower than the difficulty
die, add a \emph{setback}. Advantages and setbacks cancel out.

If a character faces more than two penalty dice, they may opt to \emph{Take a
Risk} and remove two penalty dice, downgrading their attempt dice to two~$d8$s.
This increases their chances of success at the cost of dramatically increasing
the probability of a setback. If any penalty dice remain, they may opt to
\emph{Take a Greater Risk} and remove two more penalty dice, downgrading their
attempt dice to two~$d4$s.
